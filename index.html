            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Over my many years of travelling around the world, I have encountered 
                many things, both marvelous and dangerous. As a well-versed traveller, I 
                collected whatever souvenier I could to remember these encounters. This 
                site contains some of the many items I've brought back with me, both
                big and small...actually, that's a lie, all these items are small. 
                As small as they may be, they all carry their own story. Take a gander
                at the marvelous collection before you and see for yourself!

            <h2>Egyptian Camel Phone</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                This story is a doozy. There I was in the harsh Egyptian desert, alone on a camelback. 
                I was almost out of water and there wasn't a soul in sight. Desperate for help, I tried
                to use my phone to call emergency services, but it slipped out of my sweaty hands and the damn
                camel stepped on it! I made it out alive of course, being the dashing and handsome man that
                I am, but it was definitely an experience that gave me quite the fright! Lesson learnt, never
                use your phone and ride a camelback.
                </p>

            <h2>Chinese Vial of Venom</h2>
            <div>
                <p>This vial of venom was acquired from 'milking' a King Cobra.
                Snakes are not a rare sight there, especially in the rural areas. Despite how commonplace they are 
                to see, they're still dangerous, however. I actually got bitten by one and almost didn't make it when 
                the hospital didn't have the right antidote! which is exactly why I had to milk it of its venom. That 
                way, I can make the antidote myself if I ever get bitten by a snake again, it's a genius and fool-proof 
                plan!</p>

            <h2>Australian Outback Gem</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Australia is known for being a mining country, so is it really a surprise that I was able
                to get my hands on a real beauty of a diamond? I fought tooth and nail for this and then had to
                make a daring escape through a collapsing tunnel. I almost didn't make it! I lived, fortunately, 
                and I was able to make back with this stunning gem. I had it cut, of course, and now it stands as
                one of my most prized valuables in this collection. Don't get any ideas though....

            <h2>Pakistani Mosquito Repellant</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Now, you may be wondering, why on Earth is <em>this</em> in a collection of
                <strong>memorable</strong> travel items? Well, you see, mosquitos are quite the problem abroad,
                literally coming in droves. I thought I was being smart when I got this mosquito repellant from 
                a local store owner. All you have to do to use it is apply a single drop or dot of it onto your
                shoulders and thighs. I did as per the instructions and sure enough, I had a bout of malaria within
                the week.</p>

            <h2>French Butterfly Knife</h2>
            <div>
                <p>This item comes from one of my more violent encounters. This knife made its way into
                my thigh after I found myself in an attempted mugging. I say attempted because I fought 
                those hooligans with everything I had! With the scoundrels knockd out cold, I had to rush 
                to the ER for the copious amounts of blood I was losing due to this rusty knife. It's nothing special,
                really, just like any other buttefly knife, but the memory it carries is just as thrilling as it was
                painful.</p>

            <h2>British Bulletshells</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Another case where I had to get my hands dirty. These bullets are from actually from genuine
                1945 longarm rifles, which makes it all the more confusing as to how a group of British thugs got
                their hands on it. I took care of them, of course, but I was unforunately unable to salvage the rifles.
                The oafs broke it while trying to hit me over the head with it! All I could gather from that encounter
                were these bulletshells, a reminder that no matter which era it's from, a bullet will put you out all the same</p>

            <h2>Indian Ganesha Idol</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Finally, an item in this collection that isn't related to me dancing with death! This is an idol
                of the Hindu Deity Ganesha, made of a soft sandstone. Ganesha is often known as the God of Success and 
                Wisdom, all things that I already am. This idol was gifted to me by the locals as a token of our friendship
                and I still hold it dear to this day. The idol brings back pleasant memories of my travels in India and makes
                me long to go back one day.</p>

            <h2>Assorted Coins</h2>
            <div>
                <p>To top off this collection, coins! Who doesn't like coins? These aren't from any particular country, 
                rather they're from different places and eras. Some of these places include Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore,
                Hong Kong and even Imperial India. In fact, some of these coins date as far back as <em>1835</em>! For those
                of you who don't know, that's during the time the British occupied the country and it shows, given how the coins
                feel as though they're from an entirely different country, but I digress.</p>

            <h2>About the Owner</h2>
            <p>Ipsum Lorem is an eccentric international traveller who has been to over 50 different countries. A philantropist
            at heart, he uses the money made from his treasure-hunting to build hospitals and orphanages, all of which are 
            dedicated to him and him alone. This collection is one of many and can be viewed at his home personally through
            an appointment. As of today, Ipsum Lorem is trapped in his home, unable to travel due to border closure</p>
